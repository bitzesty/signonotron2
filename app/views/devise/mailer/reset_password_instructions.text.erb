Someone has requested a link to change your password, and you can do this copying-and-pasting the link below into your browser's URL bar:

<%= edit_password_url(@resource, :reset_password_token => @token) %>

If you didn't request this, please ignore this email.
Your password won't change until you access the link above and create a new one.
The link will be valid for 6 hours and will only work once.
