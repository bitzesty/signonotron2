A Signon administrator has changed your <%= t('department.name') %> Signon <%= account_name %> email from <%= @email_was %> to <%= @user.email %>.

You will now need to sign in using your new email <%= @user.email %>.

If your email address shouldn't have changed you should contact a managing <%= t('department.name') %> editor in your organisation or your parent organisation.
